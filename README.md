# 🎙️ Audio Signal Processing - ICA Speaker Separation

This project performs **Audio Signal Processing** using **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)** to separate multiple speakers from a mixed audio file. It applies **machine learning techniques** like **K-Means Clustering** and **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** for **Blind Source Separation (BSS)**.

## 📌 Features
✅ **Automatically detects and separates multiple speakers**  
✅ **Estimates the number of speakers dynamically (no hardcoded values!)**  
✅ **Identifies speaker contributions in percentage**  
✅ **Generates clear visualizations:**
   - 📊 **Pie chart of speaker contributions (`speaker_contribution.png`)**
   - 🎵 **Waveform of separated speakers (`separated_speakers.png`)**
✅ **Saves results in structured formats:**
   - **CSV (`ica_speaker_analysis.csv`)**
   - **Excel (`ica_speaker_analysis.xlsx`)**
✅ **Smooth user experience with a progress loader**
